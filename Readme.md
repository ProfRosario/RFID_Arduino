RFID_Arduino
============

The goal of this project is read the Parallax RFID serial data and store the data to EEPROM without the need of 
the Arduino IDE once the firmware has been loaded. The Arduino library should be able to read serial data,add master 
and user tags to memory and delete all stored tags in memory. 

Test Environment
================
The code has been tested only on the Arduino Uno card and the Parallax 2400 baud serial card (SN #28140 Rec C).

Pending Tasks
============
1. Add master tag to memory
2. Add user tags to memory
3. Delete tags from memory
4. Fix boolen bug in code (might be IDE related)
5. Add comments to code
6. Add debug feature for diagnostic
7. Stress test code in real environment
8.
